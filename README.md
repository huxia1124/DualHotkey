# DualHotkey
An implementation of Visual Studio dual hotkey

Visual Studio allows you to bind a combination of two hotkeys to a command, such as (Ctrl+K,Ctrl+C) to comment code and (Ctrl+K,Ctrl+U) to uncomment.

This is a sample of how the hotkey combination is achieved. It is an MFC application but can be easily ported to other Win32 projects.
